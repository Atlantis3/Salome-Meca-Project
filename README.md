The python [file](https://github.com/Atlantis3/Salome-Meca-Project/blob/master/Geometry%20Python%20Scripts/geometry4.py) helps created the 3d model of the Body Centred Cube (BCC) in the open source software.

## How to use 
- At first download and save the python file on your pc and edit the dimensions and parameters for your design.
- You will need to have Salome Meca installed on your PC. Although the software is available only for linux os, with Windows11's feature of WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux), you can install Salome Meca on your pc. You can check there are many youtube videos explaining how to install it.

- Once in Salome Meca software, go to file --> load scipt and select the python file.

- Go to geometry module and the 3d model would have been generated  for you. Just expand the tree and right click and show and you can see the part.

- You can then export the part into step or stl file format for 3d priting.
